# Mental-Health-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning
Overview

This project analyzes mental health survey data to uncover trends, patterns, and influencing factors that contribute to mental well-being in the workplace. The analysis provides insights into key psychological and organizational factors that impact employees' mental health and productivity.

🧩 Objectives

Analyze the distribution of mental health indicators from survey data.

Identify the relationships between job-related variables and mental health outcomes.

Use machine learning models to predict mental health conditions or stress levels.

Interpret model predictions using SHAP for transparency and explainability.

🧰 Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation

numpy – Numerical computations

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms and evaluation

xgboost & lightgbm – Gradient boosting models

shap – Model interpretation and feature importance

📊 Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and categorical encoding

Standardizing and normalizing numerical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions and correlations

Analyzing demographic and job-related factors affecting mental health

Modeling:

Training and comparing ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Evaluating model accuracy and performance metrics

Explainability:

Using SHAP to interpret feature importance and understand model decisions

Conclusion:

Key insights and recommendations based on data-driven analysis

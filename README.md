# 🧠 Mental Health Survey Analysis

## 📄 Overview  
This project analyzes **mental health survey data** to uncover trends, patterns, and influencing factors that contribute to mental well-being — especially within workplace environments.  
The analysis focuses on identifying key psychological and organizational elements that impact employees' mental health and productivity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore and visualize mental health indicators from survey data.  
- Identify correlations between job-related factors and mental well-being.  
- Build machine learning models to predict mental health outcomes.  
- Interpret model predictions using SHAP for transparency and explainability.

## 🧠 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Scale and normalize data  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understand data distribution  
   - Visualize relationships between features  
   - Identify key stress and satisfaction factors  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Training and comparing ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
   - Evaluating model accuracy and performance metrics  

4. **Explainability**  
   - Use **SHAP** to interpret feature importance and understand model decisions  

5. **Conclusion**  
   - Derive insights on major contributors to mental health  
   - Provide recommendations for improving well-being in workplaces
